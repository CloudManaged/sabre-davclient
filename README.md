sabre/davclient
===============

A WebDAV, CalDAV and CardDAV client for PHP.

Note that this library is completely non-functional at the moment ;)

Installation
------------

Make sure you have [Composer][3] installed. In your project directory, create,
or edit a `composer.json` file, and make sure it contains something like this:


```json
{
    "require" : {
        "sabre/davclient" : "dev-master"
    }
}
```

After that, just hit `composer install` and you should be rolling.

Questions?
----------

Head over to the [sabre/dav mailinglist][4], or you can also just open a ticket
on [GitHub][5].
